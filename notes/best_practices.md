# Best Practices for Collaboration

- Always synchronize your branches before starting any work of your own.
- Avoid having very large changes that modify a lot of different things.
- When working on a big change, it makes sense to have a separate feature branch.
- Regulary merge changes made on the master branch back onto the feature branch.
- Have the latest version of the project on the master branch, and a stable version of the project on a separate branch.
- You should not rebase changes that have been pushed to remote repos.
- Having good commit message is important.
