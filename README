# Git Practice Manual (VCS)

This project contains practice code for learning and using **Git** (Version Control System).

---

## What is Git?
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in files and collaborate with others.

---

## Basic Git Commands

### 1) Initialize a Git Repository
Creates a new Git repository in the current folder:

```bash
git init
```

---

### 2) Check Repository Status

Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked:

```bash
git status
```

---

### 3) Add Files to Staging Area

Add a specific file:

```bash
git add <file>
```

Add all files:

```bash
git add .
```

---

### 4) Commit Changes

Saves the staged changes as a new version:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add initial project files"
```

---

### 5) View Commit History

Displays all commits made in the repository:

```bash
git log
```

Short version (clean view):

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## Typical Workflow

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git log
```

---

## Skipping the staging area

```bash
git commit -a
```

---

## Getting more information from the user

```bash
git log -p
git show <commit_id>
git log --stat
git diff
git add -p
git diff --staged
```

---

## Renaming or deleting a file using git

```bash
git mv <old_file> <new_file>
git rm <file>
```

---

## Adding a .gitignore file

.gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch. 

When writing a .gitignore file, there are some specific formats which help tell Git how to read the text in the file. For example, a line starting with # is a comment; a slash / is a directory separator. Visit https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore to see more examples.

This GitHub repository offers some examples of configurations which are often included in a .gitignore file. These examples include: compiled sources, packages, logs, databases, and OS generated files.

##  Notes

* `git add` stages changes (prepares them for commit).
* `git commit` permanently saves those staged changes.
* Use `git status` frequently to stay aware of what is happening.
* `git diff` shows the changes before add the changes to the staging area.
* `git add -p` shows the changes that we have made and ask us whether to add to staging area or not.
* `git diff --staged` shows the changes to the files already added to staged areas.
* `git log -p`, `git show <commit_id>`, and `git log --stat` shows the changes after the commit.
* `git mv <old_file> <new_file>`can be used to rename or move a file.
* `git rm <file>` can be used to remove a file and mark it untracked.
