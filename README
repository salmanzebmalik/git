# Git Practice Manual (VCS)

This project contains practice code for learning and using **Git** (Version Control System).

---

## What is Git?
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in files and collaborate with others.

---

## Basic Git Commands

### 1) Initialize a Git Repository
Creates a new Git repository in the current folder:

```bash
git init
```

---

### 2) Check Repository Status

Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked:

```bash
git status
```

---

### 3) Add Files to Staging Area

Add a specific file:

```bash
git add <file>
```

Add all files:

```bash
git add .
```

---

### 4) Commit Changes

Saves the staged changes as a new version:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add initial project files"
```

---

### 5) View Commit History

Displays all commits made in the repository:

```bash
git log
```

Short version (clean view):

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## Typical Workflow

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git log
```

---

##  Notes

* `git add` stages changes (prepares them for commit).
* `git commit` permanently saves those staged changes.
* Use `git status` frequently to stay aware of what is happening.
